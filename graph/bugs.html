<h1>Known Bugs and Problems with V2.2</h1>

<ol>
  <li>The ParseFunction class fails to pass the exponent of the power operator
      correctly. The solution is to place parenthesis () around the offending
      text to force precidence.
  <li>The parse function class cannot parse intrinsic functions with more than
      two parameters.
  <li>Special function class Statistic functions are incomplete.
  <li>On the Mac. the XOR of 2 colors does not seem to work correctly. This
      means that the rubberband drag rectangle looks interesting to say the
      least.
