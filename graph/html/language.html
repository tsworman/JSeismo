<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>BuildGraph Language</H1>
The language interpreted by the BuildGraph class is (hopefully!) simple 
and straight forward. It is made up of about 20 reserved words, some words 
having multiple meanings depending on context. The best way to understand
how to construct a graph definition file is to look at
examples.
<P>
Context is changed using a  keyword and a { } pair. In C this would be considerd the 
scope. Only a subset of keywords can change the context. These keywords 
usually define an object that must be constructed from a set of definitions
examples of such objects are fonts, axis, datasets, titles, labels etc.
<P>
The BuildGraph language is not complete. Some plot 
features available in the class definitions are not available in the plot 
language.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>The Interpreter</H2>
The language interpreter only recognises predefines keywords, numbers 
(scientific notation is recognised), the context (scope) defining 
braces { }, and strings delimetered by ".
<P>
Everything following the # characeter is interpreted as a comment. All 
blank lines are ignored.
<P>
Anything else will be reported as an error.
<HR>
<H2>Context keywords</H2>
To change context a keyword is followed (and encloses context commands) by 
a pair of braces. An example of a new context is the font context.<BREAK>
<PRE><CODE> font {
                   style bold
                   name "Helvetica"
                   size 25
                  }
</CODE></PRE>
The font command above might itself be enclosed in the title context or 
label context.

<DL>
   <DT><B>GRAPH2D</B>
   <DD>This is currently one of three main contexts (like the main 
   procedure in C). This defines the type of graph to build. A 
   non-interactive plot using the Graph2D class.
   <DT><B>G2DINT</B>
   <DD>The second type of plot to build. An interactive plot using the
       G2Dint class.
   <DT><B>CONTOUR</B>
   <DD>The third type of plot to build. An interactive contour plot using the
       Contour class.
   <DT><B>AXIS</B>
   <DD>Define an axis using keywords such as LABEL, AXIS, BOTTOM, TOP, LEFT,
       RIGHT, COLOR and ATTACH.
   <DT><B>DATA</B>
   <DD>Define a data set, using keywords such as, URL, MARKER, COLOR.
   <DT><B>CDATA</B>
   <DD>Define the data grid for a contour plot.
   <DT><B>MARKER</B>
   <DD>In the context of a dataset this keyword will define
       the STYLE, COLOR and SIZE of the marker to use for the data set.
       In the context of GRAPH2D or G2DINT it should only contain
       the URL of the marker file.
   <DT><B>TITLE</B>
   <DD>In the context of GRAPH2D, G2DINT or CONTOUR define the title of the plot. In 
   the context of AXIS define the axis title. TITLE uses the keywords NAME, FONT
   and COLOR. A title example<BREAK>
   <PRE>title {
                 name "This could be a plot title or an axis title"
                 color 0 255 255
                 font { 
                        style plain
                        name "TimesRoman"
                        size 15
                       }
               }
    </PRE>
   <DT><B>LABEL</B>
   <DD>Only to be used in the Axis context, define the axis labels, using
   the keywords FONT and COLOR
   <DT><B>FONT</B>
   <DD>Define a font using the keywords SIZE, STYLE and NAME.
   <DT><B>GRID</B>
   <DD>Define the grid to be displayed, using the keywords ON, OFF, and 
   COLOR.
   <DT><B>ZERO</B>
   <DD>Define the zero line to be displayed, using the keywords ON, OFF, and 
   COLOR.
