<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Example 5</H1>
This plot looks like a repeat of example 3. The difference is that the
plot is built from a script file using the BuildGraph class. All
aspects of a plot (well nearly all) can be specified through a script
<A HREF="../html/language.html" TARGET="_top">language</A>. The interpreter
and accompanying applet then allows a user to incorporate plots into a
Web page without the need to learn in detail the Graph classes or
Java.
<P>
<B>NOTE</B> The script language is already becoming unwieldy and will have
to be totally rewritten sometime in the future.
