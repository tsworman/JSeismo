This is an example of <I>real</I> data (courtesy of
<A HREF=http://www-igpp.llnl.gov/people/gregg.html>Michael Gregg</A>)<BR>
The data is stored in a file on the server and is
retrieved by the applet. There are approximately 2500 data points in the
file.
<P>
This applet uses the G2Dint class to build the plot. This allows the user
some interactive control over the plot and the ability to retrieve data points.
