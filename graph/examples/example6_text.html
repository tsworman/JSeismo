This plot demonstrates the use of the <A HREF="Contour.html" TARGET="_top">Contour Class</A>.
The contour levels are either manually set or automatically set.
<P>
The Contour class is an extension of the
<A HREF="G2Dint.html" TARGET="_top">G2Dint</A> class and therefore has  all
the interactive control of that class. It also has the following extra
event handlers
